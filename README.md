# vermont_address

Vermont state address data sets used in the paper "Generated loss, Augmented Training, and Multiscale VAE", originally downloaded from https://openaddresses.io. Longitude and latitude values may differ from the source within floating point inaccuracy since these csv files were converted back from the Protocol Buffer messages.
